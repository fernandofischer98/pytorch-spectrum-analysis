    "We are going to build an algortihm that will translate a given IR spectrum to a SMILES sequence. The algorithm is based on the common Encoder Decoder structure. This algorithm is highly based on Ben Trevetts work https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq \"1 - Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\". The main deviation from the paper he based his algorithm on, is that instead of using a Recurrent Neural Network Encoder, we will use a Convolutional Encoder, mainly because we had promising results in our previous algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that even though this algorithm converges, a very high accuracy shouldn't be expected. Besides using a small very small dataset, the IR spectrum has never been known to have all the information needed to generate a full molecular structure. \n",
